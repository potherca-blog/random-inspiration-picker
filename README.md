# Random Inspiration Picker

Randomly select drawing challenges to add constraints and variety to drawing sessions.

## Background

On July 16, 2013, after a discussion about adding more challenge to my drawing sessions, I brainstormed ways to interact with my drawing media and wrote down the things I did least.

For each, I made a small card. Every time I sat down to draw, I would randomly grab three cards and try to adhere to those challenges while drawing.

There were two main drawbacks: I couldn’t use the cards if I didn’t have them with me, and they were getting worn out.

So, I created a digital version—the Random Inspiration Picker.
