        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            One day (July the 16 2013 to be precise), I had a discussion about
            adding some more challenge to the drawing I would occasionally make.
        </p>
        <img class="pull-left" src="./11333766_874661742625656_937588652_n.jpg" />
        <p>
            After brainstorming all the various ways I could interact with the
            media I use to draw with, I wrote down all the things I did <em>least</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            For each of these things I made a small card. Now everytime I sat
            down to make a drawing I would randomly grab 3 cards from the stack.
            <!-- @TODO: Add picture of physical cards-->
        </p>
        <p style="clear:both;">
            When drawing I would try to adhere to those 3 challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were, however, two main drawbacks to these cards.
            The first was that I could not use the cards if I did not have them
            on my person. The second was that cards were beginning to show their
            usage, becoming smudgy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="pull-right" src="https://robohash.org/Potherca" />
            So I decided to make a digital version.
